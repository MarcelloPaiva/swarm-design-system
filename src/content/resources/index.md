## Sketch UI Kit
The Sketch UI Kit can be downloaded from Abstract. You can view an activity stream in [Abstract's web app](https://app.goabstract.com/organizations/30c1e774-d1af-4ecb-9fec-7ba940203098?projectId=fe53f5c0-55e0-11e7-90a1-638d6300638d), but you can only download the Sketch file through Abstract's desktop app after being invited to our Abstract account.
If you aren't on Meetup's Abstract account, you can email [mikep@meetup.com](mailto:mikep@meetup.com), or contact the Design Systems team in our Slack channel: #design-systems
