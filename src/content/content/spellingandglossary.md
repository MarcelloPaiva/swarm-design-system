# Spelling

### Numbers
We like numbers and aren’t afraid to use them in their proper numerical form. When it comes to starting a sentence in long form, we spell out all numbers below 10. When it’s used in a phrase—like number one or do the two-step or three’s a crowd—we spell out the number. When we’re starting a headline, giving instruction, or counting steps, we use the numeral.

## Glossary
### Basic / Basic plan
The lowest level pricing plan limiting the number of members and organizers permitted in a Meetup group


### community 
People getting together face to face and talking about what matters to them. Our purpose is to spread real community at a local level on a global scale. 


### co-organizer
Member of a Meetup that has organizer privileges for that Meetup group


### contributions 
Members can chip in to help their organizers with costs through our Contributions feature


### event* 
This word does not exist in Meetup’s vocabulary. As the truest instance of a Meetup, all events are called Meetups and saying “event” is off limits. Unless you’re writing for SEO or ASO, you’ll always use Meetup instead. If you’re also talking about any other forms of Meetup (group or product), use Meetup group or Meetup platform to clarify. 


### group* 
The Meetup group is the essential unit for local community, referred to as Meetup group or simply as a Meetup. We don’t just use the word “group” alone. It is our goal for all group names to include the word Meetup. 

### GUAC
For internal use only—this term is short for “Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada”


### Meetup 
Meetup always has a capital M, a lowercase u, and no spaces. It can refer to an event, a group, or our company/brand. Its meaning is heavily contextual. Meetup is the preferred name for an event as well as for a group. (For more, read the “Meetup” as a word section.)


### Meetup HQ
Everyone working at Meetup used to work at Meetup HQ. Sometimes we sign emails from “The Team at Meetup” not  “from Meetup HQ.” We don’t refer to “staff” or “employees.”


### Meetuppy
For internal Meetup HQ use only. Used to described things that look and feel like our brand, our culture, and our company.
