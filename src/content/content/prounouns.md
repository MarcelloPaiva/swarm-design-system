# Pronouns


### First person
The only time we use first person is when Meetup is speaking as a brand, either about our brand or about or new features.

e.g. Let’s do this, We’re so excited you’re here, We’re introducing…, etc.


### Second person 
Buttons, tabs, ads, and links that invite members or organizers to take an action.

e.g. Your profile, Start your own Meetup, Edit your profile, Update your photo, Find your people


### Third person 
If we’re speaking to the media about our brand, we speak about what Meetup is in the third person. When we talk about what Meetup is doing, we switch to first person.

e.g. Meetup is the largest community of groups who get together in real life.
