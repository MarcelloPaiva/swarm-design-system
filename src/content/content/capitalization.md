# Capitalization
Here’s our take on capitalization for special use cases beyond the Chicago Manual of Style.

### Headers and subheads
Generally, headers and subheads are in sentence case with no period unless there are two sentences or it’s a question. Some exceptions have been made for emphasis.
e.g. Start your perfect Meetup, Do more of what matters to you, etc.

### Short descriptions
Whether it’s an error message or a Meetup event card component, short descriptions have no period unless there are two or more sentences.
e.g. You must pick a start time so you pick an end time, 19 people going, etc.

### Calls to action
CTAs always take the form of sentence case with no period and no ampersands.
e.g. Agree >, Submit and send

### People
Whether it’s a member, co-organizer, or organizer, people are always lowercase.
e.g. Meetup groups, organizers, members, etc.

### Groups and events
We encourage Meetup group and event names to be in [title case](http://titlecapitalization.com/) but currently do not enforce it across the platform.
e.g. NY Tech Meetup, Brooklyn Bowling Meetup Group, Walk and Talk: Learn Macro Photography in Red Hook, etc.

### Time
In most instances, we use all caps AM and PM. In body copy, we use this style 9am–6pm to signify duration.
e.g. 6:00 PM

### Product features
Product features are always in title case to help them stand out in body paragraphs. Once they’re used in context, you can shift to lowercase.

### Examples
When using Meetup Messages, you can send a message to any member—even if you’re not in the same Meetup group. 
This Meetup group requires Member Dues. Once you’ve paid these dues, you’ll be able to join and attend Meetups.
You’re now accepting contributions from your members. You can turn Contributions off at any time in your Group Settings.
