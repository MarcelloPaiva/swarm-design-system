# Basics
Beyond our brand tone of voice, writers can use this section to review our writing guidelines for spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

## What's in a name?
Members sign up for Meetup and join groups. Meetup groups host Meetups so members can meet up. 

* Meetup is our company, brand, and product, while meet up is a verb. As a noun, Meetup always begins with a capital M, contains a lowercase u and no spaces. Not MeetUp or Meet Up or, our personal favorite, Meetup.com. We own the trademark on Meetup but we do not protect it.

* As a verb, it’s “meet up” as two words.

## Style Guide
Generally, we follow the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/figures.html) and the [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). We use [American English](http://www.lukemastin.com/testing/spelling/cgi-bin/database.cgi?action=view_category&database=spelling&category=A) (plus emojis!) in global channels (e.g. social media) and local spelling in local channels whenever possible (e.g. email, notifications, etc.).
