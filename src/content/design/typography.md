# Typography

All of the metrics in Swarm Design System are based in our typography and our typographic scale. Text is the most common way information is displayed in Meetup’s products, so we’ve developed a polished typographic system that provides hierarchy and ensures our content is always readable.

## Colors

By default, text uses the **Primary** text color. For example: body copy and page titles

Text that calls for less visual hierarchy uses the **Secondary** text color. For example: captions, and text field labels

The quietest and lowest priority text uses the **Hint** text color. This text color should be used for content that serves as an enhancement, so only use this for content that’s “nice to know”, not “need to know”. For example: Text field placeholders, disabled content, and hints of course.
