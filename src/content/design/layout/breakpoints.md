# Breakpoints

We design for small screens by default, but adapt our UIs for larger viewports. The table below shows what we've already defined as breakpoints for Swarm Design System. It's unlikely that a design will require a breakpoint we haven't specified, but it's ok to write something custom in the web app code to support a design spec.
