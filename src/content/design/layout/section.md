# Section

[Section](https://meetup.github.io/meetup-web-components/?selectedKind=Section&selectedStory=default&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=0&downPanel=kadirahq%2Fstorybook-addon-actions%2Factions-panel), like _Stripe_, is used to separate content visually; it might help to think of _Section_ like a "sub-Stripe". While _Stripe_ cuts across the entire page to divide segments of content, _Section_ has left and right margins, so it's contents never touch the edges of the viewport.

_Section_ separates content visually using whitespace and an optional bottom border. There is a variant of _Section_ that has a bottom border and bottom padding.

Sections contain double spacing at the top, and a single space at the bottom. This is because a _Section_ typically contain Chunks, which also have a sinlge space at the bottom.
