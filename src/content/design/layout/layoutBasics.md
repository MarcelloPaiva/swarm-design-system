# Layout

We have a set of responsive layout components to design and build with. On top of handling general layout concerns (e.g. creating columns, separating regions of the page, etc.), layout components create consistent spacing between content.

Designers are encouraged to experiment with layouts to suit whatever content they’re designing for—these components and concepts are simply a baseline. Our layout components are designed to make it simple for engineers to quickly put together a responsive page layout with consistent spacing.
