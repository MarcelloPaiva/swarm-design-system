# Icons
Our icons are a light and airy with rounded corners to resemble the nature of our Swarm logo. Icons help us clearly communicate when text isnâ€™t enough. Our icon set was designed to complement our typography, and comes in two weights.

Engineers can use the [Swarm icons package](https://github.com/meetup/swarm-icons) to build with the latest icons. Designers have access to these icons in our Sketch UI kit, which can be downloaded through Abstract.

## Design guidelines
We created some guidelines to make it easier for us to create new icons that are visually consistent with the others.

### Keylines
The keylines act as a grid for our icons, and they help us to maintain consistent space and proportions. We have two sets of keylines - the default keylines, and keylines for icons that are displayed at smaller sizes. The keylines for icons displayed at smaller sizes help us keep the icon shapes from becoming too dense and unreadable.

### Weight
To keep our icons feeling light and airy, we have use two weights. The default weight, and a lighter weight for icons that are displayed at smaller sizes.
