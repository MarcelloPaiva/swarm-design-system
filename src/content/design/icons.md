# Icons
Our icons are a light and airy with rounded corners to resemble the nature of our Swarm logo. Icons help us clearly communicate when text isnâ€™t enough. Our icon set was designed to complement our typography, and comes in two weights.

Engineers can use the [Swarm icons package](https://github.com/meetup/swarm-icons) to build with the latest icons. Designers have access to these icons in our Sketch UI kit, which can be downloaded through Abstract.
