# Icons
Icons help us clearly communicate to users when text isn’t enough. Our icon set was designed to pair nicely with our typography, and comes in two weights. By default, our icons are displayed as the “Light” variant. When icons are displayed at the size m or above, the Bold weight is used to visually match the density the of Thin weight when icons are rendered at their more commonly used smaller sizes.

Engineers can the [swarm-icons](https://github.com/meetup/swarm-icons) package to build with the latest colors.
Designers have access to these icons in the Sketch Swarm Design system, which can be downloaded through Abstract.
