# Creative filters
Before creating anything for Meetup, whether youâ€™re brainstorming ideas for an experience, social media story, or new product feature, use our creative filters as a guide. 

1. Is it impactful? Will it help people meetup and transform more lives?
2. Is it spirited? Will it help people have fun and be engaged?
3. Is it real? Will it create more real-life connection and authenticity?
4. Is it welcoming? Will it help people feel safe, included, and comfortable?
5. Is it thoughtful? Will it feel considered, intentional, and kind?
