# Brand guidelines
Doing stuff with real people in real life makes powerful things happen. Everything we create—from innovative product features to IRL experiences—enables and inspires millions of people to meetup. This includes the words we write, the interactions we design, the pictures we feature, and the stories we share with the world.

With these brand guidelines, we immerse everyone who creates for Meetup in our values and essence. The more unified we are, the larger the impact we will have on lives. Let’s do this.

**Purpose:** Real community for everyone<br />
**Mission:** We bring people together in real life to do more of what matters to them
