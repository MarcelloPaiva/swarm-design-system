# i18n (internationalization)
Meetup's apps are meant to be used by everybody, no matter what language they speak or where they live. We strive to ship a product that to be adapted to various languages and regions.

## Basic concepts
* **Internationalization (i18n):** The practice of building a product which supports localization, globalization, and translation.
* **Localization (l10n):** Adapting your product to a particular locale (country/language)
* **Globalization:** The process of becoming global product, which works everywhere and for everyone
* **Translation:** An important part of localization, but only the tip of the iceberg

## Languages we support in 2017:
* English (United States) - Default
* French (France)
* German (Germany)
* Italian (Italy)
* Japanese (Japan)
* Portuguese (Brazil)
* Spanish (Spain)
* Spanish (Global)
* English (Australian)
* Dutch (Netherlands) - BETA
* Korean (Korea) - BETA
* Turkish (Turkey) - BETA
* Thai (Thailand) - BETA
* Polish (Poland) - BETA
* And more to come in the future!

_Note:_ Don't assume language based on country or location. For example: in NYC alone {stat} households don't speak English as their primary language; Spanish is spoken in countries across the world, not just Spain; Canadians speak French and English

---------------------------------------

## Product considerations

### Designing for translation
* When designing an interface, consider that English text can become much longer when translated to other languages.
	-_show English vs German UI_
* Avoid making components that contain text a fixed-width. This prevents them from growing or shrinking to support translations of different lengths.
* Wrapping text in components is preferred to truncating the text. You may be cutting off important information in another language.
* Avoid making components that read like sentences—other languages do not follow the same word order as English. It's best to design the component so that each piece of information is self-contained and can be understood no matter what order they appear in.
	-_show weird filter example_
* Don't put text inside of a graphic, it can't be translated

For reference, here's a chart of text expansion rate from [IBM's globalization guidelines](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/guidelines/a3.html):

### Rethinking our NYC-based biases
Many of Meetup's employees live near Meetup HQ in NYC. However, most of our users to not. Here are some ways the rest of the world is different from New York:
* Cities are smaller
* There are no trains, more trains or faster trains
* People are more likely to be shy
* The American concept of “community” does not exist or is different
* The internet access is bad or better
* The devices are different
* The language is different
* People are richer or poorer
* People have money but no credit cards or have credit cards but no money
* Population is generally older or generally younger

### Devices and internet access
In most parts of the US, we're lucky to have powerful computers and fast internet. However, this isn't the case globally.

Most people use cheaper devices offered that run Android or something else:

## Intercultural design considerations
Culture, language, and society affect how people think and communicate, which affects how people respond to design.

### Be aware of
* Visual symbology
* Color meanings
* Perceptions of rudeness
* Hierarchy
* Gender roles
* History
* Politics
* Attitude towards institutions
* Business communication styles
* Religion

### Connect and empathize
* Remember our novice status in different cultures
* Focus on what's the same, not what's different

### Don't assume or judge
* Avoid positive and negative stereotypes about different cultures
* Don't take your values and knowledge as the default
* Be aware of the stereotypees other cultures have about us

### Cultural dimensions:
#### Individualism
Individualism vs collectivism, Personal needs vs. the needs of a wider group. This can apply to copy and images you choose.

* Individualist cultures respond to youths, sense of self, and personal achievement
* Colectivist cultures respond to larger groups, age diversity, and consideration for their broader community

_For example:_
**Individualist**|**Collectivist**
---------------- | ----------------
Australia        | Ecuador
Canada           | Guatemala
Great Britain    | Indonesia
Netherlands      | Pakistan
USA              | Panama

#### Power distance
Strong centralized authority vs flat hierarchy; Power distance refers to the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally.

* High PD cultures respond to tight IA, limited choice, formal layout, and strong/bold imagery
* Low PD cultures respond to informal presentation, broad/explorable IA, and varying workflow options

_For example:_
**High power distance**|**Low power distance**
---------------------- | ----------------------
Guatamala              | Austria
Malaysia               | Denmark
Panama                 | Ireland
Phillipines            | Israel
Venezuela              | New Zealand

#### Uncertainty avoidance
Uncertainty avoidant vs. low certainty; Uncertainty avoidance deals with a society’s tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity

* Uncertainty avoidant cultures respond to emphasis on clarity. For example, giving warning messages for unconventional behavior
* Low certainty cultures are more open to discovery and browsing

_For example:_
**Uncertainty avoidant** | **Low certainty**
------------------------ | ------------------------
Greece                   | Singapore
Portugal                 | Jamaica
Guatemala                | Denmark
Uruguay                  | Sweden
Belgium                  | Hong Kong

#### Gender role dichotomy
Masculine vs. feminine; In masculine societies, gender roles are more aggressively divided

* Masculine societies respond to bold, short-form, straightforward designs, and imagery showing showing personal gratification and success
* Feminine cultures respond to social interactions, female colors, and iconography

_For example:_
**Masculine**| **Feminine**
-------------| -------------
Japan        | Sweden
Hungary      | Norway
Austria      | Netherlands
Venezuela    | Denmark
Italy        | Costa Rica

#### Long-term orientation
Considering impact on the future vs impact now

* Long-term oreinted cultures value persistence, thrift, and having a sense of shame
* Short-term oriented cultures value personal steadiness/stability, reciprication of greetings and gifts, and tradition

_For example:_
**Long-term**| **Short-term**
-------------| -------------
China        | Venezuela
Hong Kong    | Uruguay
Taiwan       | UAE
Japan        | Turkey
South Korea  | Switzerland

## Engineering considerations

### How do we default members to a language?
* Apps
	- Language chosen at the OS level.
	- Apps contain bundles of translated strings for built in copy
	- API requests set an ‘Accept-Language’ header requesting content in the language of the device
	- We attempt to match the value of this header with one of our supported languages, defaulting to english if we can’t.

* Web - logged out
	- Defaulted based on Accept-Language header of request (usually set in browser settings)
	- Can change via language choice dropdown, sets a cookie

* Web - logged in
	- Meetup account page setting (changeable on Desktop only, through settings).

On the web, URLs maintain a ‘language/country folder’ parameter which should *always* match the locale the page is rendered in. (e.g.: https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/about/). We redirect you to the folder of your account if you are logged in.

### Adding new TRNs
* Android
	- _content to be provided by...someone_
* iOS
	- _content to be provided by...someone_
* Web
	- _content to be provided by...someone_

### TRN do's and dont's
#### TRN full text blocks
* Word order changes across languages
* Need of suffix, prefix between words
* Other weird reasons we haven’t encountered yet

_Example: ‘I can’t contact Bill’ becomes ‘I Bill can’t contact’ in Japanese. ‘23 members’ becomes ‘23 people of the type member’ in Japanese (need of linking element 人の between 23 and member)_

#### Include HTML/Markup only
...and really only, when it’s necessary for the purposes of not breaking a unit of copy/sentence into different chunks as outlined on the previous slide.

#### Avoid referencing specific locales in code
Hardcoding a link is akin to referencing a locale.
Create a parameter for URLs, as these can be passed in with the appropriate locale info through there.

#### Include punctuation
Do not hardcode any character. If you assume it’s not gonna change, you’re most likely wrong!

_Examples:_
* Here are the quotes in French: «   »
* Here is a period in Japanese: 。
* In French, there HAS TO to be a non-breaking space before a colon

#### If using keys, namespace your keys depending on the project/feature you’re working on.
That helps the translation team to group keys by projects and understand context better. We usually don’t use underscores in key names, but it would work if you do. Giving an indication of the context in the key helps a lot (Button, title…)

ALLL cross-platform keys should use the prefix `xplat.*` (e.g.: `xplat.NotificationNewMUP`)

_Example:_
Keys for start flow web are `start.createMeetupButton`

#### Avoid common.* keys (or any keys meant to be shared across features) anymore.
Our translation memory tool should address the problem of duplication, it’s not the role of the engineer to define what can be reused by namespacing the keys, and in most cases it doesn’t work (grammar, vocabulary changes with context).

#### Templating placeholders
Placeholders are safe for invariable data, numbers, things were you really need an element of the sentence to change, User-generated content like Group name, Chapter name, etc.

But it’s not recommended to create variables as a shortcut (in order to avoid creating several TRNs, for example) for nouns, verbs, stuff that is grammatically subject to change. Grammar is complex, it will create problems.

If using named placeholders, please make them  precise, and understandable.

Commonly accepted placeholder terminology at Meetup:
* GROUP_NAME
* EVENT_NAME
* MEMBER_NAME
* MEMBER_COUNT
* DATE
* CITYNAME
* PRICE

_Example:_
* Good: `{NUM_MEMBERS} members are going to {EVENT_NAME}`
* Bad: `This Meetup is {STATUS_OF_MEETUP} (Cancelled, scheduled, modified…)`

Do not create a placeholder for the currency.
`{PRICE}` will show the local currency (if applicable) and the right formatting for that local currency depending of the locale used.

_Example:_
/fr-FR/ (French, France) should (eventually) serve 20€ for {PRICE}
/en-ie/ (English, Ireland) should (eventually) serve €20 for {PRICE}

#### Date formatting
Use standard formats! If your framework provides standard localized formats, use those. See [time and date content guidelines](/content/timeanddate.html) for more information.

* Don’t assume grammar structure is the same in every language
* Don’t assume something won’t change
* Don’t assume it will fit (this one is mostly important for designers)
* Don’t use CSS properties automatically converting text, they are not universal, especially Auto Capitalization that creates problems for other languages.

#### Pluralization
If “1” and “several” get the same grammar in English, it’s unlikely the case in other languages.
_Example:_ `{NUM}` going

We have the same grammar for 1 going and 34 going in English, but this isn't necessarily true for other languages. Other languages need of a string for 1 going and 34 going.

Some formats (XLIFF) don’t support key pluralization, so if this is what you’re using, make several TRNs for singular and plural case in this situation.

### Modifying and copying of existing TRNs
If you need to change the existing copy of a TRN used on the production environment, the current best practice is to actually create a new key (you can add an incremental number to your key name, like string.nameexample2)
this ensures that the new key/copy gets picked up and sent to our translators as needing to be translated.
Also this is the best way to avoid conflicts with any other places that this copy could be used.

If it’s just an update to a key that isn’t yet deployed on production environment (for example, copy changing during QA step), you can update its copy and run `fix --trn` again to update Transifex.

When the copy in your branch is ‘ready to go’, run fix --trn! What does it do?
* Runs trn extraction on your branch
* Finds new keys
* Uploads them to Transifex

What is Transifex?
It’s the platform we currently use to manage copy and translations.  Once new keys are uploaded to phraseapp, our translators are signaled to take a look at the new copy and provide localized versions of it.
