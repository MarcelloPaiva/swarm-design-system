# a11y (accessibility)
Meetup's apps should be built and designed at a high enough quality to accomodate users of all abilities. Our products should adapt to our users - our users shouldn't have to adapt to our products.

## Accessible for who?
Sometimes exclusion is temporary, sometimes it's situational.

#### Think about using your phone:
* while holding a subway pole
* using your phone outdoors in bright light
* in a big/loud crowd
* while holding something else

### Microsoft's Persona Spectrum
"By designing for someone with a permanent disability, someone with a situational limitation can also benefit. For example, a device designed for a person who has one arm could be used just as effectively by a person with a temporary wrist injury or a new parent holding an infant. We call this the Persona Spectrum."

### Some stats
* 9.1% of adults with vision trouble [Source: Disability and Functioning, CDC], and 8% of men and 0.5% of women who are color blind [Source: Color Blind Awareness]
* 16.8% of adults with hearing trouble [Source: Disability and Functioning, CDC]
* 15.1% of adults with physical functioning difficulty [Source: Disability and Functioning, CDC]
* 4.4% of adults with cognitive disabilities [Source: 2016 Disability Statistics Annual Report (PDF)]

## Design considerations
"Accessibility will not force you to make a product that is ugly, boring, or cluttered. It will introduce a set of constraints to incorporate as you consider your design. These design constraints will give you new ideas to explore that will lead to better products for all of your users."
—[Jesse Hausler](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/7-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-accessibility-64f105f0881b)

### Color and contrast
Avoid using color as the only means of communicating information. e.g.: a check that turns from grey to green to indicate that it's active.

Our minimum text contrast ratio is 3:1. The WCAG guidelines require contrast ratio between text and background to be at least 4.5:1 for normal-sized text and 3:1 for large text for an AA rating. **Tip:** When designing, pretend you'll be showing it on a projector or crappy TV. That's closer to what users with vision impairments or even just lower quality monitors will experience.



### Touch targets

### Hierarchy and focus

### Avoid hiding content or controls
Instead of hiding actions and information behind hover states, explore more inclusive alternatives.
* Place secondary actions inside of menus (or non-modal dialogs), without using hover states to hide the trigger.
* Lighten the contrast of secondary icons and darken them on hover.
* Use tangible items as triggers for larger hovers. An info icon is a better trigger than white space to launch a content-filled hover.

### Experiencing Meetup using assistive technology

#### Keyboard navigation
Consider `:focus` styles. The tab key navigates through various interactive elements on a page. A default visual indicator is provided by the web browser - usually a blue shadow or outline. When an element is in focus, it can be further activated using the keyboard.
Some examples of `:focus` styles can be seen in our `Button` component, `Dropdown` component, and all of our form components.

#### User-scaled text
Consider how your design looks when a user scales text using their browser or their device accessibility settings. Don't stress too much about this, just keep it in mind.

### Forms
* Don't rely on placeholder text as Make sure inputs are clearly labeled. In the rare case you have a field or set of fields that doesn't work with a visual label, at least come up with a label for screen readers to use.
	- _show do/don't example_
* Avoid using only color alone to indicate errors
	- _show do/don't example_
* Text inputs should have clearly defined boundaries - for example: a border, a background color, etc
*

### Charts and Graphs
Charts, and graphs are visual representations of complex data. However, since they are images, these provide serious accessibility issues to colorblind users and users of screen readers. Alternate methods of display must be provided to these users.

* For data in charts and graphs a text description of the data contained within must be provided
* For color-coded charts, supplement colors with texture to provide enough contrast for colorblind users to distinguish
differences in areas.
* A good method for complex charts is to provide the data in a tabular format allowing users to toggle between the various representations of the data presented.

## Engineering considerations

### Images
Adhere to the following guidelines for image tag attributes. Adherence provides web accessibility by allowing content and function to be accessed by users with visual or certain cognitive disabilities. Additionally, it provides semantic meaning and description that can be read by search engines.
The ALT attribute for the image tag is to be included in every image tag and adhere to the following guidelines. For more information on the appropriate use of the alt attribute, including examples, visit the site, [Web Accessibility in Mind](http://webaim.org/).

The `title` attributes for images or links should be used on an as needed base, when additional advisory information is needed for images. This information will be displayed on the hover of the image.

#### `alt` text guidelines:
* Never contain special characters (e.g., registration symbols).
* Alternative text may be provided in the alt attribute or in the surrounding context of the image.
* Decorative images still need an alt attribute, but it should be empty (alt="").
* Alternative text should present the _content_ and _function_ of the image and be succinct.
* Alternative text should not be redundant (be the same as adjacent or body text) or use the phrases "image of..." or "graphic of..."
* Appropriate alternative text depends heavily on the image's context.
* Alt text of a functional image (e.g., an image within a link) should describe the function as well as the
content.

_Image tag example:_
`<img src="faffPicnic2017.jpg" alt="Foreign Androids Feeling Frustrated group photo" />`

### Input labels
Label elements should be used for accessibility purposes to associate the field name with the field itself. Form fields should immediately follow the label element and be true to the flow of the document and a wrapper should be used to separate each form field.

_Text input example:_
```
<label for=”event-title”>Event title</label>
<input type=”text” name=”event-title” id=”event-title” value=””/>
```
