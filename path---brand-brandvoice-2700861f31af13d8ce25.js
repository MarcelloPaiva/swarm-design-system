Here are some dos and don’ts to help keep in mind as you write for Meetup.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Our voice is...</th>\n<th>Our voice is not...</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Real and genuine</td>\n<td>Formal or cute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Welcoming and helpful</td>\n<td>Indifferent or transactional</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spririted and lively</td>\n<td>Passive or forced</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thoughtful and informed</td>\n<td>Careless or cliché</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Impactful and empowering</td>\n<td>Superficial or uninspired</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<h2>Our voice is real and genuine</h2>\n<p>Speak conversationally, avoiding formalities. Keep it casual and natural—if you wouldn’t say it to a friend, then just don’t say it that way. Write with a glimmer behind your eye.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> You’re in. We’re excited to have you on board.<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Success! The Meetup group you created has been approved.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Meetup with local groups to do more of what you’re into<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> What are you loving right now? Next up, try it on Meetup!</p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP</strong><br/>\nSlang is subjective but like, try not to go full cray. Everything will eventually need to be localized.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Our voice is welcoming and helpful</h2>\n<p>When we’re inclusive and inviting, our members and organizers feel comfortable to be themselves. Write as if you’re the host of an intimate dinner party. Try to be helpful, moving people forward through the experience, creating no dead ends.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> It won’t be the same here without you<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Are you sure you want to unsubscribe?</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Keep your title under 65 characters<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Oops! Try again—this title is too long.</p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP</strong><br/>\nWould it feel right if you said it with jazz hands? Then don’t do it—this can get preschool teacher really fast. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Our voice is spirited and lively</h2>\n<p>At the bottom of everything, we’re all here to have a good time. When the moment calls for the brand to really shine, keep it fun and lighthearted with relatable copy that will guarantee a smile. Go for more of a wink and a nod than a knock-knock joke.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Actually use your oven. Explore cooking Meetups nearby.<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Show me the Meetups</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Your passions won’t pursue themselves. Start your perfect Meetup.<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Pursue your passions. Start a Meetup today.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Shoot. Someone already thought of that.<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Error. This username is taken.</p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP</strong><br/>\nBe mindful that using really spirited copy in areas of the experience that members see all the time can read as disingenuous. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Our voice is thoughtful and informed</h2>\n<p>Can you say it in half the characters? Please do. We value our members’ time and intellect so we’re always considering how to be more succinct and clear. Also, if you’re making a smart reference, don’t think twice—they’ll get it.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Got questions? Get answers in our Help Center<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Click here to read our Help Center FAQs and get a tour</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Tabs vs. spaces. French press vs. Aeropress. Write code with others who care about caffeine.<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Drink lattes and make code with other programmers and coffee enthusiasts near you</p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP</strong><br/>\nOne way to seem more considerate is to use relatable language that people in the community will understand.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Our voice is impactful and empowering</h2>\n<p>Driving change with community collaboration and social transformation is at the heart of what we do, so everything we say should reflect the impact we’re trying to create in the world. Using imperative, inspiring language and thought-provoking questions helps motivate members and organizers.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> If you’re looking for a sign, this is it. Meetup organizing is half off today.<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Today on Meetup: Manifest destiny! Half the price, for a limited time.</p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Show up. Change lives. Start a Meetup.<br/>\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Let us help you change the world. Start your Meetup today.</p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP</strong><br/>\nFocus this kind of copy in touchpoints where coaching and inspiration makes the most sense.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Brand voice",supportingContent:null}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{title:"meetup-web-components",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/components/",topLevelDir:"Components",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Resources",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/resources/",topLevelDir:"Resources",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Overview",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/brand/",topLevelDir:"Brand",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"mup-web",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/components/mup-web/",topLevelDir:"Components",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Basics",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/content/basics/",topLevelDir:"Content",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Color",supportingContent:"colorListing"},fields:{slug:"/design/color/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Layout basics",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/layoutBasics/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Creative filters",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/brand/creativefilters/",topLevelDir:"Brand",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Capitalization",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/content/capitalization/",topLevelDir:"Content",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Buttons",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/buttons/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Stripe",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/stripe/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Brand voice",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/brand/brandvoice/",topLevelDir:"Brand",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Punctuation",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/content/punctuation/",topLevelDir:"Content",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Icons",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/icons/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Bounds",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/bounds/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Brand assets",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/brand/brandassets/",topLevelDir:"Brand",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Spelling and glossary of terms",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/content/spellingandglossary/",topLevelDir:"Content",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Typography",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/typography/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Section",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/section/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Time and date",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/content/timeanddate/",topLevelDir:"Content",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Forms",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/forms/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Flex",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/flex/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Pronouns",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/content/prounouns/",topLevelDir:"Content",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Social media",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/content/socialmedia/",topLevelDir:"Content",subDir:""}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Chunk",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/chunk/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Spacing",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/spacing/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"a11y (accessibility)",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/usability/a11y/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Usability"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Sizing",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/sizing/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"i18n (internationalization)",supportingContent:null},fields:{slug:"/design/usability/i18n/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Usability"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Breakpoints",supportingContent:"breakpointListing"},fields:{slug:"/design/layout/breakpoints/",topLevelDir:"Design",subDir:"Layout"}}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"/brand/brandvoice/",topLevelDir:"Brand",subDir:""}}}});
