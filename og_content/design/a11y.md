# a11y (accessibility)
Meetup's apps should be built and designed at a high enough quality to accomodate users of all abilities. Our products should adapt to our users - our users shouldn't have to adapt to our products.

## Accessible for who?
Sometimes exclusion is temporary, sometimes it's situational. For example, **think about using your phone:**

* while holding a subway pole
* using your phone outdoors in bright light
* in a big/loud crowd
* while holding something else


### Microsoft's Persona Spectrum
> "By designing for someone with a permanent disability, someone with a situational limitation can also benefit. For example, a device designed for a person who has one arm could be used just as effectively by a person with a temporary wrist injury or a new parent holding an infant. We call this the Persona Spectrum."
— Microsoft Inclusive Design manual

### Some stats
* 9.1% of adults with vision trouble [Source: [Disability and Functioning, CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm)], and 8% of men and 0.5% of women who are color blind [Source: [Color Blind Awareness](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/)]
* 16.8% of adults with hearing trouble [Source: [Disability and Functioning, CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm)]
* 15.1% of adults with physical functioning difficulty [Source: [Disability and Functioning, CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm)]
* 4.4% of adults with cognitive disabilities [Source: [2016 Disability Statistics Annual Report (PDF)](https://disabilitycompendium.org/sites/default/files/user-uploads/2016_AnnualReport.pdf)]

## Design considerations
> "Accessibility will not force you to make a product that is ugly, boring, or cluttered. It will introduce a set of constraints to incorporate as you consider your design. These design constraints will give you new ideas to explore that will lead to better products for all of your users."
—[Jesse Hausler](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/7-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-accessibility-64f105f0881b)

### Color and contrast
Avoid using color as the only means of communicating information. Provide other visual cues to communicate important states; elements like text, stroke, or icons can be helpful here.

![Don't rely on color as the only communication tool](/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/a11y/a11y_dontRelyOnColorAlone.png "Don't rely on color as the only communication tool")

Our minimum text contrast ratio is 3:1. The WCAG guidelines require contrast ratio between text and background to be at least 4.5:1 for normal-sized text and 3:1 for large text for an AA rating. **Tip:** When designing, pretend you'll be showing it on a projector or crappy TV. That's closer to what users with vision impairments or even just lower quality monitors will experience.

Important icons text should follow our contrast guidelines, but decorative elements or "nice-to-know" text can bend the rules a bit.

#### Color testing tools:
* [Stark](http://www.getstark.co/) - Sketch plugin for testing for contrast ratios and simulating color blindness
* [Contrast ratio checker](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/) - Simply checks for contrast ratio between two colors
* [Contrast finder](http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/) - checks contrast ratio and recommends accessible colors if your color combo fails
* [Color Tool (by Google)](https://material.io/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0) - Check for accessibility in color combos or small color pallettes
* [Hex Naw](https://hexnaw.com/) - Can test full color pallettes and identify accessible and inaccessible combos
* [Contrast](https://usecontrast.com/) - macOS app

### Touch targets
Touch targets should be at least 40px. This translates to a physical size of about 7mm, regardless of screen resolution.
Touch targets should be spaced at least 8px to ensure balanced information density and avoid accidental taps on adjacent touch targets.

![Make tap targets tappable](/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/a11y/a11y_makeTargetsTappable.png "Make tap targets tappable")


### Hierarchy and focus
* Lay out content according to it's relative level of importance
* Place important actions at the most easily reached parts of the screen, which is typically at the edges and at the top or bottom of the viewport.
* Try to group related items together

#### Focus order
Users who use keyboard navigation or assistive technology will depend on a logical focus order. Input focus should follow the visual order of the layout, from the top to the bottom of the screen. If you design with a clear hierarchy, a predictable and sensible focus order should happen almost automatically.

Try this out by going to Facebook or Google's search results page and navigate using your tab keys, arrows, and enter keys.


### Avoid hiding content or controls
Instead of hiding actions and information behind hover states, explore more inclusive alternatives.
* Place secondary actions inside of menus (or non-modal dialogs), without using hover states to hide the trigger.
* Lighten the contrast of secondary icons and darken them on hover.
* Use tangible items as triggers for larger hovers. An info icon is a better trigger than white space to launch a content-filled hover.

### Experiencing Meetup using assistive technology

#### Keyboard navigation
Consider `:focus` styles. The tab key navigates through various interactive elements on a page. A default visual indicator is provided by the web browser - usually a blue shadow or outline. When an element is in focus, it can be further activated using the keyboard.
Some examples of `:focus` styles can be seen in our `Button` component, `Dropdown` component, and all of our form components.

#### User-scaled text
Consider how your design looks when a user scales text using their browser or their device accessibility settings. Don't stress too much about this, just keep it in mind.

### Forms
Text inputs should have clearly defined boundaries - for example: a border, a background color, etc

Don't rely on placeholder text as Make sure inputs are clearly labeled. In the rare case you have a field or set of fields that doesn't work with a visual label, at least come up with a label for screen readers to use.
	![Don't use placeholder as label example](/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/forms/forms_noPlaceholderAsLabel.png "Don't use placeholder as label example")

Avoid relying on color alone to indicate errors

For more information about designing forms for Meetup, see the [Forms](./forms.html) guidelines.

### Charts and Graphs
Charts, and graphs are visual representations of complex data. However, since they are images, these provide serious accessibility issues to colorblind users and users of screen readers. Alternate methods of display must be provided to these users.

* For data in charts and graphs a text description of the data contained within must be provided
* For color-coded charts, supplement colors with texture to provide enough contrast for colorblind users to distinguish
differences in areas.
* A good method for complex charts is to provide the data in a tabular format allowing users to toggle between the various representations of the data presented.

## Engineering considerations

### Images
Adhere to the following guidelines for image tag attributes. Adherence provides web accessibility by allowing content and function to be accessed by users with visual or certain cognitive disabilities. Additionally, it provides semantic meaning and description that can be read by search engines.
The ALT attribute for the image tag is to be included in every image tag and adhere to the following guidelines. For more information on the appropriate use of the alt attribute, including examples, visit the site, [Web Accessibility in Mind](http://webaim.org/).

The `title` attributes for images or links should be used on an as needed base, when additional advisory information is needed for images. This information will be displayed on the hover of the image.

#### `alt` text guidelines:
* Never contain special characters (e.g., registration symbols).
* Alternative text may be provided in the alt attribute or in the surrounding context of the image.
* Decorative images still need an alt attribute, but it should be empty (alt="").
* Alternative text should present the _content_ and _function_ of the image and be succinct.
* Alternative text should not be redundant (be the same as adjacent or body text) or use the phrases "image of..." or "graphic of..."
* Appropriate alternative text depends heavily on the image's context.
* Alt text of a functional image (e.g., an image within a link) should describe the function as well as the
content.

_Image tag example:_
`<img src="faffPicnic2017.jpg" alt="Foreign Androids Feeling Frustrated group photo" />`

### Input labels
Label elements should be used for accessibility purposes to associate the field name with the field itself. Form fields should immediately follow the label element and be true to the flow of the document and a wrapper should be used to separate each form field.

_Text input example:_
```
<label for=”event-title”>Event title</label>
<input type=”text” name=”event-title” id=”event-title” value=””/>
```
