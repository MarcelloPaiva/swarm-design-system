When it comes to starting a sentence in long form, we spell out all numbers below 10. When it’s used in a phrase—like number one or do the two-step or three’s a crowd—we spell out the number. When we’re starting a headline, giving instruction, or counting steps, we use the numeral. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Glossary</h2>\n<h3>Basic / Basic plan</h3>\n<p>The lowest level pricing plan limiting the number of members and organizers permitted in a Meetup group</p>\n<h3>community</h3>\n<p>People getting together face to face and talking about what matters to them. Our purpose is to spread real community at a local level on a global scale. </p>\n<h3>co-organizer</h3>\n<p>Member of a Meetup that has organizer privileges for that Meetup group</p>\n<h3>contributions</h3>\n<p>Members can chip in to help their organizers with costs through our Contributions feature</p>\n<h3>event*</h3>\n<p>This word does not exist in Meetup’s vocabulary. As the truest instance of a Meetup, all events are called Meetups and saying “event” is off limits. Unless you’re writing for SEO or ASO, you’ll always use Meetup instead. If you’re also talking about any other forms of Meetup (group or product), use Meetup group or Meetup platform to clarify. </p>\n<h3>group*</h3>\n<p>The Meetup group is the essential unit for local community, referred to as Meetup group or simply as a Meetup. We don’t just use the word “group” alone. It is our goal for all group names to include the word Meetup. </p>\n<h3>GUAC</h3>\n<p>For internal use only—this term is short for “Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada”</p>\n<h3>Meetup</h3>\n<p>Meetup always has a capital M, a lowercase u, and no spaces. It can refer to an event, a group, or our company/brand. Its meaning is heavily contextual. Meetup is the preferred name for an event as well as for a group. (For more, read the “Meetup” as a word section.)</p>\n<h3>Meetup HQ</h3>\n<p>Everyone working at Meetup used to work at Meetup HQ. Sometimes we sign emails from “The Team at Meetup” not  “from Meetup HQ.” We don’t refer to “staff” or “employees.”</p>\n<h3>Meetuppy</h3>\n<p>For internal Meetup HQ use only. Used to described things that look and feel like our brand, our culture, and our company.</p>\n<h3>member</h3>\n<p>Refers to those belonging to a Meetup group as well as anyone on the Meetup platform</p>\n<h3>Member Dues</h3>\n<p>Payment requirements set by organizers for members to join and stay in the Meetup group</p>\n<h3>MUP</h3>\n<p>For internal use only—this term is short for “Meetup event”</p>\n<h3>MUG</h3>\n<p>For internal use only—this term is short for “Meetup group”</p>\n<h3>organizer</h3>\n<p>A member who starts a Meetup group and is responsible for the group’s fees as well as general group management. Groups may have one or more co-organizers who help facilitate.</p>\n<h3>Organizer Dues</h3>\n<p>Monthly fees paid by an organizer to keep a Meetup group going as a part of the Meetup platform</p>\n<h3>pricing plans</h3>\n<p>Set subscription fees tailored to organizers’ and their Meetups’ needs </p>\n<h3>RSVP</h3>\n<p>Attendance response of yes or no when used as a noun. Also used as a verb for the action of attending, or planning to attend, a Meetup: RSVPs and RSVPed, never RSVP’s or RSVP’d. </p>\n<h3>subscription</h3>\n<p>Monthly fees paid by an organizer to keep a Meetup group going as a part of the Meetup platform [also see Organizer Dues]</p>\n<h3>ticket</h3>\n<p>Feature allowing organizers to charge members a one-time fee for a specific Meetup</p>\n<h3>Unlimited / Unlimited plan</h3>\n<p>The standard pricing plan placing no limits on the number of members and organizers permitted in a Meetup group</p>\n<h3>Other common terms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>internet</li>\n<li>email</li>\n<li>website</li>\n<li>tweets/retweets</li>\n<li>RSVPs/RSVPed</li>\n<li>FAQs (no apostrophe) </li>\n<li>“like” (when referring to social media
